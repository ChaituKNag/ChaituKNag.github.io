&lt;p&gt;I mean so much happiness and excitement on the one side and a total void on the other. Why the void, you might ask? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all humans and we do mistakes, we learn from them, then try not to repeat them, then miserably repeat them and fall down like dried leaves of a dying tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a small town in eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh, India called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuni&quot;&gt;Tuni&lt;/a&gt;. That was a different world, now that I even go back into those incredible memories. My thoughts deepen, my legs feel the chill and nostalgia filled heart, whenever I go through those memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I studied till my plus-two there in that town and went on to pursue my B.Tech in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakinada&quot;&gt;Kakinada&lt;/a&gt;. I met my current ongoing future there. High-tech lifestyle, prospective opportunities, dream-filled faces and what not, it was a miracle how my life ended up there and eventually here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college showed me the path to technical career and I got campus-placed in one of the biggest corporate giants in India, soon to join the office as a rookie in the garden city of India, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore&quot;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a race, everybody tries hard to win. But race is only a part of life, there are lives that beg you to stop and listen and cherish the moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got married in the first year of my professional career. There are no plans, no complicated strategies towards budgeting, planning and implementing them. I went with my family as the wind takes the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge in technologies like Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML strenthened, I grew as a web-developer with backend programming experience. I worked on creating eCommerse and sales web-sites such as large US banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed the city, changed the company, this time it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad&quot;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; and the company is one of the biggest mutual fund companies of US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found peace, amid all the turmoil that was going on all around. Cool people, bundles of joy, table tennis. In house projects, cool code-releases, scrum meetings, morning coffees, innovative hackathons… these were the routine there. Heaven could have been dull before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first kid was born. Life slowed down to a graceful smooth ride. Started feeling the father-sense, the love only a father can have towards his family. Care that cannot be explained, but it is to be experienced. I knew, the man in me is finally maturing. It all started making sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career picked up pace, new technologies are swirling all around, people again trying to catch the wind, shouts everywhere, fancy things started in office, funny behaviors, unexpected new friends, shouts, cries, hatred, bromance, all filled the mind with memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet…!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day came after 5 years when I had to say, enough is enough. This is a grown-up man now, who wants to step up and stand-by his family. No more take-it-easy strategy. I resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The current&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third company is the perfect place for a person like me. Full of innovative thinking, never to be seen communication strategy, networking, open minded people all over. Huge community of geeks, nerds and fun-bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious turn of my career, cool and energetic stuff happening every minute, keeping myself busy and yet productive, fun and vision running side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to brag, but the latest best thing that happened to my life and family is this new workplace. My mind opened up, no more relaxing, no more missing out on all the cool innovation and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continues, life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rash opossum less because less some amid besides yikes jeepers frenetic
impassive fruitlessly shut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
