&lt;p&gt;Well, its about my work life, if you feel excited, read on… If you don’t care, feel free to read on anyway, coz you may relate to it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506718468845-7578aa47670b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;#x26;auto=format&amp;#x26;fit=crop&amp;#x26;w=1500&amp;#x26;q=80&quot; alt=&quot;Stack of grounded stones&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aint grounded, you aint rounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was as innocent during the later part of my B.Tech graduation days as anybody could think of. You know, even before that, in my junior college days, I used to not care knowing about the future, what might be the goal of a person finishing junior college in the discipline I was in (M.P.C - maths, physics and chemistry). All I cared about was the day-in day-out stuff, the momentary happiness. I could’t care less about the future as the days approached where others were very tense and skeptical. I just relaxed..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the attitude was simple. I will face my future when I get there, so I will have time to worry about it. So, why think about it. Well, now that I think about it, the philosophy sounds cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gurus of Indian and Telugu philosophical and spiritual realm really paved a good way for thinking positively and practically in my generation of students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did not know that there was something called a degree college where I had to do my graduation. So, there was no question of knowing anything beyond that. I don’t remember now, but I was not having any idea how/why people work so hard when there were my age now. Well, not knowing was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally knew that the EAMCET entrance exam is a thing to plough yourself through to the Technical courses called Bachelor of Engineering (or Technology). Rest of the folks had to go for an ordinary degree. From where I come, there is still a wide divide between the 4 year long technical engineering degrees and the 3 year long regular degrees. The rift is pretty big in terms of how people treat you in society and even jobs mandated an engineering degree in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I worked hard in the second year of my junior college, cracked the exam with a good state level rank (1224 out of 200000+ applicants) and joined the engineering college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the 3rd year of graduation, I started getting more information on what happens beyond the college. People either fetch jobs, or go for post-graduation. I was not sure how either of them would work. So, I waited. Then the campus hires happened and I cracked the interview and got an offer in a reputed Indian corporate company. I felt happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Twist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516796248643-97015ffc715d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;#x26;auto=format&amp;#x26;fit=crop&amp;#x26;w=1500&amp;#x26;q=80&quot; alt=&quot;Man facing the sun&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the twist was that I was a Mechanical Engineering student, the company that offered the job was known for its IT services. So, the next question was, what would I do in that job, was it going to be mechanical stuff or IT related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I had one more year to go before joining the company, so I had plenty of time to think about it. The seniors who joined companies started telling that the work is unrelated to what we learn. Some even discouraged going after the job, instead, tried motivating to go for post graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the old laid-back friend in me told me, let the future come. I will face whatever that life gives me in the form of this job and I will take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, eventually I joined the job, it was dealing with software. I learned, whithered, bothered. At one point, I thought I might have taken a wrong step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The wait-and-see game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we call it the game of patience when it comes to life choices and jobs?!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good way or bad way of doing things. It is always, how you respond to the outcomes of those things. Do you learn something, do you try to not repeat the mistakes, do you always shy away from challenges or do you persevere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sayings are useful here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think, that you will definitely be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it is unbearable pain, frequent exposure to challenges will make winning them second nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combine these two and you got yourself a &lt;em&gt;recipe for success&lt;/em&gt;. There are always people who think they know better than anyone. Never even think about them. In fact, you always know better than anyone else, &lt;strong&gt;about yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the path that will make you good at what you do. You will feel pain, you will be frustrated. Find options to mitigate the negative effect, there are plenty of them. Get yourself occupied with the thoughts of your goal. Make your goal your own, be one with it and the first rule above applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to be a good public speaker, the first thing I need to do is &lt;strong&gt;think myself as a good public speaker&lt;/strong&gt;. Mind takes those thoughts as positive signals and like a mould, your mind gets the shape of those thoughts and without doubt you will become a good public speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see people chill out, thinking that their job is just a way to pass time, spend with colleagues in meaningless chatter and go home convincing the managers that there is nothing to worry, whereas they don’t even know how to fix the issue themselves the next morning. It repeats, fooling around in cafes, whining about the bad hikes and bonus numbers, debating who would be the next boss in office, and politics of the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this waste of energy, oh my dear God, could as well be used in improving oneself. Why is it that they don’t care. They thought themselves as escapists, and future escapes from them, money and satisfaction escape from them and then finally life will be a daily struggle for existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thinking wisely always pays-off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I wish I could always say more motivating things to help others, but everybody has a way of looking at life and the world. They won’t listen, you will be belittled. Those who listen though, will succeed. The formula is clear, &lt;strong&gt;take it or leave it, take it and you succeed, leave it and it leaves you.&lt;/strong&gt;. My life is founded on the stones of being laid-back about future, taking the present seriously and always thinking about what I want to be in a conscious manner. Hope you do follow and control your thoughts too, because whatever you think, that you will definitely be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t go after success, but go after excellence and then success comes searching for you.&lt;/em&gt; — 3 Idiots movie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;strong&gt;well grounded&lt;/strong&gt; now, more on this will follow in next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up as usual on that day, getting ready to go to office, but as I just brushed my teeth and walked towards the Deewan, all of a sudden, I felt the pain and collapsed on the Deewan itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after sometime passed that my wife realized the severity of the issue, because I generally tend to lay down on the bed for sometime before kickstarting the day. But I decided to take the day off at office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I informed others at office as well about the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How severe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512615199361-5c7a110a8d11?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;#x26;auto=format&amp;#x26;fit=crop&amp;#x26;w=1950&amp;#x26;q=80&quot; alt=&quot;The X-Ray&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I could not even go to the wash room because I could not get up from the Deewan. I was not even able to turn around. I had to use my upper body strength to even slightly move the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed still till the evening, only getting up in the afternoon to have some food and go to bathroom once in the middle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening at 4pm, my wife rushed me to Mythri hospital in Ashok Nagar (Chandanagar) in Ola Auto and I got admitted in the Out-patient ward and they immediately tested my condition and advised an X-ray test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sister gave me a pain-killer injection on the back (ironically the injection itself was painful) and then I went for the X-Ray. The technician there positioned me in front-on and sideways positions and after some time I was moved to the waiting area for doctor visit. At 6pm the doctor came. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1449177009399-be6867ef0505?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;#x26;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;#x26;auto=format&amp;#x26;fit=crop&amp;#x26;w=1950&amp;#x26;q=80&quot; alt=&quot;The heavy lifting of life&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was no bone-fracture or bone-related issue at all. It was but a muscle tear issue (muscle got torn near the spine), this generally would happen if I did some heavy-lifting or heavy work just before that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I remembered, I never did any such thing. So, this came down to either &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad sleeping posture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While tongue-cleaning that morning I might have done the coughing up of waste in a rigorous way that might have accidentally triggered the muscle tear. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My elder kid (Tamoghna) sometimes plays on my back, even to the extent of jumping on the lower part when I sleep facing down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A combination of all the above along with sitting postures issue at workplace. Though, I highly doubt about the sitting posture, as I take good care of my back during worktime and I move around quite a lot especially in my new workplace.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anyway we came home after being prescribed some muscle relaxing medicine and Volini pain relief cream. Most importantly, I need bed-rest for atleast a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should say, this is the first time I have had that kind of severe pain in the lower back and not being able to even change my posture in the bed for the next 24 hours or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am slowly recovering from the issue but on the second and third days, for some weird reason, my motions went out of control (went loose) and I went more than 10 times to the bathroom on the second and third days. So, today (30th Jan), we again went to the same doctor to understand if this is due to the prescribed medicines. He gave some other medicine as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife, funnily told that doctor and the people in the OP room on Monday, all kinds of made-up reasons why I might have got the issue in the first place: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That I don’t eat rice anymore and so because of imbalanced diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That I eat a lot of biscuits in an attempt to quench my hunger. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That I might have an issue with my kidneys due to the diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That I lost too much weight and so I got this issue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the people including the doctor dismissed the assumptions. She even suggested the doctor to prescribe a kidney check-up during the second visit for which the doctor said there is no such need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor lady.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sister checked my BP on Monday it was &lt;em&gt;120/80&lt;/em&gt;, first time that I noticed the normal BP after all these years. I attribute this normality in BP to the &lt;strong&gt;stricter diet&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;continual jogging sessions&lt;/strong&gt; that I am doing these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after the doctor visit on Monday, I decided to give myself some rest this week. So, leave at office, I informed the concerned team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends, take care of your backs, don’t allow any pressure on your backs while playing with kids or lifting heavy stuff (even kids) and during any daily activity that involves heavy things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean so much happiness and excitement on the one side and a total void on the other. Why the void, you might ask? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all humans and we do mistakes, we learn from them, then try not to repeat them, then miserably repeat them and fall down like dried leaves of a dying tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I come from a small town in eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh, India called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuni&quot;&gt;Tuni&lt;/a&gt;. That was a different world, now that I even go back into those incredible memories. My thoughts deepen, my legs feel the chill and nostalgia filled heart, whenever I go through those memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I studied till my plus-two there in that town and went on to pursue my B.Tech in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakinada&quot;&gt;Kakinada&lt;/a&gt;. I met my current ongoing future there. High-tech lifestyle, prospective opportunities, dream-filled faces and what not, it was a miracle how my life ended up there and eventually here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The college showed me the path to technical career and I got campus-placed in one of the biggest corporate giants in India, soon to join the office as a rookie in the garden city of India, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore&quot;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a race, everybody tries hard to win. But race is only a part of life, there are lives that beg you to stop and listen and cherish the moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got married in the first year of my professional career. There are no plans, no complicated strategies towards budgeting, planning and implementing them. I went with my family as the wind takes the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge in technologies like Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML strenthened, I grew as a web-developer with backend programming experience. I worked on creating eCommerse and sales web-sites such as large US banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I changed the city, changed the company, this time it is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad&quot;&gt;Hyderabad&lt;/a&gt; and the company is one of the biggest mutual fund companies of US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found peace, amid all the turmoil that was going on all around. Cool people, bundles of joy, table tennis. In house projects, cool code-releases, scrum meetings, morning coffees, innovative hackathons… these were the routine there. Heaven could have been dull before this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first kid was born. Life slowed down to a graceful smooth ride. Started feeling the father-sense, the love only a father can have towards his family. Care that cannot be explained, but it is to be experienced. I knew, the man in me is finally maturing. It all started making sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Career picked up pace, new technologies are swirling all around, people again trying to catch the wind, shouts everywhere, fancy things started in office, funny behaviors, unexpected new friends, shouts, cries, hatred, bromance, all filled the mind with memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet…!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day came after 5 years when I had to say, enough is enough. This is a grown-up man now, who wants to step up and stand-by his family. No more take-it-easy strategy. I resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The current&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third company is the perfect place for a person like me. Full of innovative thinking, never to be seen communication strategy, networking, open minded people all over. Huge community of geeks, nerds and fun-bombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious turn of my career, cool and energetic stuff happening every minute, keeping myself busy and yet productive, fun and vision running side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to brag, but the latest best thing that happened to my life and family is this new workplace. My mind opened up, no more relaxing, no more missing out on all the cool innovation and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It continues, life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
