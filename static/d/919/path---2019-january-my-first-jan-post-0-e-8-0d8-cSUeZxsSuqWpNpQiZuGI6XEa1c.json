Why the void, you might ask? Let me explain.</p>\n<h2>The beginning</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are all humans and we do mistakes, we learn from them, then try not to repeat them, then miserably repeat them and fall down like dried leaves of a dying tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I come from a small town in eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh, India called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuni\">Tuni</a>. That was a different world, now that I even go back into those incredible memories. My thoughts deepen, my legs feel the chill and nostalgia filled heart, whenever I go through those memories.</p>\n<p>Ok, so I studied till my plus-two there in that town and went on to pursue my B.Tech in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakinada\">Kakinada</a>. I met my current ongoing future there. High-tech lifestyle, prospective opportunities, dream-filled faces and what not, it was a miracle how my life ended up there and eventually here.</p>\n<p>The college showed me the path to technical career and I got campus-placed in one of the biggest corporate giants in India, soon to join the office as a rookie in the garden city of India, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore\">Bangalore</a>.</p>\n<h2>The career</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Life is a race, everybody tries hard to win. But race is only a part of life, there are lives that beg you to stop and listen and cherish the moments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Got married in the first year of my professional career. There are no plans, no complicated strategies towards budgeting, planning and implementing them. I went with my family as the wind takes the flavor.</p>\n<p>Knowledge in technologies like Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML strenthened, I grew as a web-developer with backend programming experience. I worked on creating eCommerse and sales web-sites such as large US banks.</p>\n<p>I changed the city, changed the company, this time it is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad\">Hyderabad</a> and the company is one of the biggest mutual fund companies of US.</p>\n<p>[:bowtie:]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13173817_10208932370362458_8513398534734977768_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&#x26;_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.xx&#x26;oh=f5c7b18d10744025fdd14a88cecc4b43&#x26;oe=5CFB1497\" alt=\"My family group photo\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First January Post of 2019!!","date":"January 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/January/my-first-jan-post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","path":"/2015/05/28/new-beginnings"}},"next":null}}
