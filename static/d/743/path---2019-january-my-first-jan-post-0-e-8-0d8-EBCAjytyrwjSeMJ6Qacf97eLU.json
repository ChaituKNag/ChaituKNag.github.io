Why the void, you might ask? Let me explain.</p>\n<h2>The beginning</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are all humans and we do mistakes, we learn from them, then try not to repeat them, then miserably repeat them and fall down like dried leaves of a dying tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I come from a small town in eastern coast of Andhra Pradesh, India called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuni\">Tuni</a>. That was a different world, now that I even go back into those incredible memories. My thoughts deepen, my legs feel the chill and nostalgia filled heart, whenever I go through those memories.</p>\n<p>Ok, so I studied till my plus-two there in that town and went on to pursue my B.Tech in Kakinada. I met my current ongoing future there. High-tech lifestyle, prospective opportunities, dream-filled faces and what not, it was a miracle how my life ended up there and eventually here.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First January Post of 2019!!","date":"January 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2019/January/my-first-jan-post/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","path":"/2015/05/28/new-beginnings"}},"next":null}}
